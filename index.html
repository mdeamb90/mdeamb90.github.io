## Welcome!

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Central European University, having recently completed my PhD in Economics at the University of Zurich, where I was a doctoral scholarship holder at the UBS Center for Economics in Society. As an applied behavioral economist, I employ both lab and field experiments to uncover how misperceptions and cognitive biases shape choices and economic outcomes. In particular, I investigate barriers to optimal decision-making in the context of human capital investments and marriage market choices.

## Research Interests

Behavioral and Experimental Economics, Empirical Microeconomics
